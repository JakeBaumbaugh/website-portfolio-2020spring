For this website, I am using Jekyll as a "template" to make creating new webpages much easier. As a result, you will not be able to download this site and open the .html files, as Jekyll would need to be downloaded to work properly. So, please view the website here: https://jakebaumbaugh.github.io/website-portfolio-2020spring/index.html. Feel free to clone the repo to view the files inside, or you can just use the "Inspect Element" tool to see it that way. Thanks!

Your final project files (html, css, images, etc) should go in here. **One of those files should be called index.html**: it will become your landing page. (Otherwise, your site will land on this readme.)

You can then publish this site to the open web: just go to your repository's Settings and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and change the source from "none" to "master branch /docs folder."
