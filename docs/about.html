<h2>About</h2>

<p>This website was created as a project for my Composing Digital Media class at the University of Pittsburgh during the Spring 2020 semester. Our assignment was to create a website from the ground up using HTML and CSS, rather than with some site builder such as WordPress.</p>

<p>For the website, I decided to showcase what can be done with p5.js, a library for JavaScript called Processing. Processing, which also has libraries for Java and Python, allows for the creation of graphics and motion with simple built-in functions. The most common use of p5.js is on Khan Academy, where the programming tutorials use this library to simplify code and encourage experimentation.</p>

<p>All projects showcased on this site were created by me. If you have any comments, suggestion, etc., I can be reached through the Email Me link on the navigation sidebar.</p>
